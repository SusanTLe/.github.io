# Reflection

- What (if anything) did you struggle with?
I think I am still struggling with the lerpColor calls. It still looks too abrupt to me, even with additional phases, so I'm not sure whether to just scrap the pink color for the sunset or not. Also, the clouds seem kind of distracting.

- What (if anything) still is not complete?
I was suggested to add some life into the canvas with animal life, a train riding along the hills, and more, but I feel like it might take away from the overall perception of a sort of time lapse for the project. I feel like I need more time to ruminate on what is appropriate  

- What questions (if any) do you have about this assignment?
Does this scream "time" something when you look at it?

- For dated addition: what has been changed?
I added info to the README.md file and also moved the code for filling in
the hill color before I begin the shape for it.

//Dated addition 12/9
-> Adjusted the following according to feedback:
-> Changed the stars function. Instead of random movement, the opacity now changes to give a sort of glitter effect
-> Changed the random speeds generated for the clouds. Now they move slower
-> Changed the way the sun and moon positions are mapped. Now they start and end off canvas before switching.
-> Changed the sine wave hill so that one hill is lower than the other
