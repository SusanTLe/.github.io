# Reflection

- What (if anything) did you struggle with?
I think I am still struggling with the lerpColor calls. It still looks too abrupt to me, even with additional phases, so I'm not sure whether to just scrap the pink color for the sunset or not. Also, the clouds seem kind of distracting.

- What (if anything) still is not complete?
I was suggested to add some life into the canvas with animal life, a train riding along the hills, and more, but I feel like it might take away from the overall perception of a sort of time lapse for the project. I feel like I need more time to ruminate on what is appropriate  

- What questions (if any) do you have about this assignment?
Does this scream "time" something when you look at it?
