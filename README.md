# Project 01 - Timepiece
The project consists of the sky and sun/moon position based on the user's time. 
The "s" or "S" key can be pressed to allow for auto mode so you can see the 
animation looping of day and night. 

## Interpretation Guide
For example, if it's 12 noon for the user, the sun will be at its highest in the canvas sky. 
The color also changes based on the user time, so when it's early morning it will be a slight 
purple that fades into a grey, then into sky blue as the sun gets higher in the sky. As it starts to set,
the sky turns more orange and pink and eventually transitions to a pitch black night time. The random tiny white dots in 
the sky are supposed to be reminiscent of star movement as the moon goes from left to right as the night progresses for the user. 
Then, it restarts the loop with the sun again.
